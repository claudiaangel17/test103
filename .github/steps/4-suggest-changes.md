## Step 4: Create an Issue with a Template

Now that you’re familiar with using GitHub Issues, let’s learn how to **create an issue using a template**!

### 📝 What is an Issue Template?

Issue templates provide a ready-made outline that helps you create issues in a consistent and structured way. You can use templates to report bugs, request features, assign tasks, or even take meeting notes!

Templates make it easier for your team to understand the issue and ensure the right information is included. They also save you time when creating new issues — no need to reinvent the wheel each time!
